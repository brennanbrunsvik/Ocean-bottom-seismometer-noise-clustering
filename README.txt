This is a minimal working example of the code used for "clustering" analysis in Janiszewski et al. 2022. While you can probably figure out how to use it yourself, I have not edited the code to be self-explanatory. If you would like to use this and find it confusing, feel free to contact me (brennan.brunsvik@gmail.com). Please also email me if you find problems. 

To get started, simply run "clusterLoopBig.m". 

The goal is to seperate ocean-bottom seismometer noise spectra into different groups based on station characteristics (such as depth). Then, evaluate the similarity between spectra in those groups. If a station characteristic produces groups that have highly similar spectral properties, then there may be a strong correlation/causation between noise and that station characteristic.
